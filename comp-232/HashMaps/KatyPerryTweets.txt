Whoâ€™s your favorite Katy Vision character - Lefty or Ebi (Twerking Tempura)? https://t.co/2dtNPv2P31		
I want to close this with a poll... https://t.co/5vO1SWSYQl		
...For example, Santa Barbara Katy is actually what I wear in Santa Barbara - hippie linen flow #AppStoreChat		
I wanted to pick highlights from every era, not just current ones &amp; I wanted to reflect who I am on and off stage... https://t.co/PwxVkccFtb		
Ha! Pulling the tech curtain aside to tell you it's just a random name generator, but makes me LOL every time. https://t.co/I9nrrD5asL		
...like my hot pink Moschino dress, could become tangible to you in the future... #AppStoreChat		
Expect the unexpected! For example, things that you see in that alternate world... https://t.co/JKNY1Carrz		
...Almost 75% of those locations will be places Iâ€™ve had IRL memorable moments in.  #AppStoreChat		
...the game will continue to update with new locations throughout its lifetime...		
I incorporated some of my favorites places in the game, from my hometown of Santa Barbara to Tokyo... https://t.co/yLrQUq09Un		
...and in the reality of the music industry, you must have talent first and foremost. #AppStoreChat		
...record label has helped write this storyline, but at the end of the day, this is not a talent-based game, it's a skill-based game...		
I think there are actual tools that can set you on the path. For example, my experience with starting my own... https://t.co/u1GYRbca9O		
...I don't think we're that far off. #AppStoreChat		
I would say Katy Vision, but according to the technology I saw during my visit to Silicon Valley last week... https://t.co/cG7tYvhegY		
I thought this would be fun way to tell my story and offer insight through poppy cartoon visuals. #AppStoreChat		
I enjoy creating alternate worlds... https://t.co/0ecUbNVFnR		
...for example, my holiday onesies are in your game closets now, as they are in my real closet #AppStoreChat		
My favorite thing is to be able to update the game in real time per my imagination... https://t.co/PmqhOrQDcJ		
...it will be a continually interactive space where a lot of my creative branches can live &amp; I can offer them a lot of firsts #AppStoreChat		
That it entertwines so much of my actual history with exclusive, fun reveals along the way... https://t.co/PwE3KSB6ud
